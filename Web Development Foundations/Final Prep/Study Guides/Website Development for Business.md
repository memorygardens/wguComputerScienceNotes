# Website Development for Business

The Web is the primary medium that many customers (and potential customers) use to find information about the products or services they want. Providing a Website is an essential step for any business today, and the Website can serve as the business's primary means of advertising and marketing. Besides using the Website to sell services, companies can also use the Web to gather vital demographic information to help further tailor products.

### Branding Concepts

A brand is a concept or collection of symbols associated with a product, service, or person. Brands can be expressed in the form of pictures, icons, logos, and other graphical representations of the item that the brand is intended to represent. The brand that a business establishes for itself can be extremely helpful in increasing the public's awareness of its product or service and can help sustain and increase the growth of the business.

-   The brand should be simple.
-   The brand should be different.
-   The brand should be safe.
-   The brand should make a promise.
-   The brand should reflect the company’s attributes.
-   The brand should reflect the company’s personality.
-   The brand should appeal to the intended audience.

You must first have a clearly established brand before you can begin to create a compelling Webpage. Consider this before you try to choose colors, determine a navigation scheme, etc. You may want to rush right into a discussion of search engine optimization (SEO), but first you must focus on the company brand. You will study SEO — which is the practice of modifying a Webpage's content so it ranks highly in search engine results.

### Development and Design

You can find Web development training, tips, tricks and advice from various resources, including courses such as the one you are taking, online tutorials, user groups, professional trade journals, scholarly writings, reference books and so forth.

A Website is part of a business's marketing effort and is the company's first form of advertising.

**_Keep it simple_** – you should structure page text so that it is easy for customers to scan.

Effectively designed pages:

-   Feature crisp, concise text (limiting the word count to half of what would be used in conventional writing).
-   Include one idea per paragraph
-   Include search engine keywords in the main portions of the text.
-   Convey the central message using the inverted-pyramid writing style (i.e., the conclusion is presented at the top of the page, followed by supporting information).

### E-commerce Considerations

Internet-based and Web-based technologies have allowed the continued growth of electronic commerce (e-commerce). Each year, more goods are being created, bought and sold using Internet technologies, and traditional businesses continue to use Web-based technologies to work more efficiently and tap new markets.

Three major e-commerce models that are widely implemented:

-   **Business-to-Consumer (B2C)** - A model in which a Web-based business sells products and/or services to consumers or end users.
-   **Business-to-Business (B2B)** - A model in which a Web-based business sells products and/or services to other businesses.
-   **Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)** - A model in which individual consumers sell products or services to other consumers.

## Internet Marketing and Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

As a member of a Web team, you must consider marketing issues because they affect the design, content, and performance of your Website. Internet marketing applies traditional marketing concepts to Web-based and Internet technologies.
![[Pasted image 20220615233853.png]]
**Search engine optimization (SEO)** involves learning how a particular search engine ranks a Website. You can use this knowledge to customize a site's Webpages so that the site is ranked as highly as possible in a search engine's results. If a page is ranked highly on search engines, that page is more likely to create situations in which potential customers purchase goods or services.

There are two types of Web analytics:

-   **On-site analytics** – studying visitor behavior once that visitor has accessed your site. You can use trend-analysis software, such as WebTrends (www.webtrends.com) and Webalizer (www.webalizer.org) to review log files and determine the number of hits (i.e., page views) your page received, the length of each stay, and demographic information about the visitors.
-   **Off-site analytics** – determining your potential audience and how well your site has addressed and penetrated a specific market. It includes identifying the size of your market, identifying competitors, determining your market penetration, conducting surveys, and consulting market research sources.

### Social Media Optimization

Social Media Optimization involves the usage of social media networks to generate awareness and traffic for your business or Website. In the modern day and age, it is essential to utilize social media to grow your online presence. Social Media Optimization links directly to search engine optimization, with large social media presence and impact positively impacting your search engine rankings. The first step to achieving a large social media impact is by creating interesting accounts on all the major social media networks, including Twitter, Facebook and LinkedIn. The next step is to regularly post interesting content regarding your product or service on these networks. Engaging with the social network communities in innovative and interesting ways is a great way to grow a social media following. When your following on these networks grow, you will notice your search engine ranking grow as well.

### e-Commerce Payment Technologies

Organizations need standard methods for exchanging funds just as much as they need standards for exchanging information. Several e-commerce payment technologies are in common use, either as transaction methods or as tools to secure transactions:

-   **Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)** – Electronic Funds Transfer) is a generic term that describes the ability to transfer funds using computers, rather than using paper. Banks use EFT to save time and ensure that monetary exchange between individuals and businesses is as secure as possible. Other large organizations use EFT as well.
-   **Payment gateways** – A payment gateway is a system, either hardware-based or software-based, that mediates between a merchant (i.e., an e-commerce-enabled Website) and an acquirer (e.g., the merchant's bank). End users do not configure their systems to become payment gateways. Once the merchant receives payment from a customer, the merchant uses the payment gateway to transmit credit card information to the bank.
-   **3-D Secure** – 3-D Secure is an XML-based protocol used by credit card companies to add security to online credit and debit card transactions. It is often listed as "Verified by VISA" or "MasterCard Secure Code." 3-D Secure has replaced the Secure Electronic Transactions (SET) protocol.

### Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) / Transport Layer Security (TLS)

Neither SSL nor TLS are transaction methods; rather, they are tools used to secure transactions. **Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) are methods used to encrypt data transmissions.** They act as the foundation for many e-commerce protocols, including 3-D Secure. You can view the SSL 3.0 specification at www.freesoft.org/CIE/Topics/ssl-draft/3-SPEC.HTM. It is important to note that SSL is deprecated and is no longer recommended. It is preferred to use TLS instead.

TLS is quite like SSL, but TLS is an open standard that is updated frequently. You can read about TLS in the Request for Comments (RFC) document 2246 (RFC 2246). TLS has rapidly become the accepted standard, although it is often called SSL or SSL/TLS.

SSL and TLS are protocols that are included within transaction methods to secure transactions. SSL/TLS secures transactions through encryption. Encryption can provide authentication, data confidentiality and data integrity. Many other encryption methods exist, but SSL/TLS is arguably the most universally applied.

**SSL/TLS and Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)**

You need a certificate to enable host authentication before you can begin an SSL session. So before an organization can use SSL/TLS to enable encryption, it must participate in Public Key Infrastructure (PKI), which is a collection of individuals, networks and computers that together have the ability to authoritatively confirm the identity of a person, host or organization.

-   **Digital certificate –** a signed public key that verifies a set of credentials associated with the public key of a certificate authority (CA). All SSL/TLS sessions require a valid certificate, which acts as a trusted third party to allow unknown parties to authenticate with each other and begin encryption.
-   **Certificate authority (CA) –** a trusted third party that verifies the identity of the person or company that has submitted a certification request (CR). A CA is an organization that issues digital certificates and helps to ensure the identity of a person, host or process. A CA is more than just a computer that issues digital certificates; a CA is an entire organization.

### Working in a Global Environment

E-commerce requires you to understand global issues. Remember that by placing a business on the Web, the audience is expanded to include anyone in the world with a browser and Internet access.

-   **Currency differences –** E-commerce sites such as eBay and global businesses such as IBM facilitate business with people in many different countries. These businesses must be able to automatically calculate exchange rates for the day of the transaction (often called currency conversion). They must also calculate taxes and tariffs on goods, which incur additional costs.
-   **International shipping –** When shipping goods internationally, you must consider searches by customs, costs incurred by customs, delays caused by customs, and all tariffs. A product you sell legally in one country may be illegal in another or heavily regulated.
-   **Language concerns –** Consider the language(s) used by the target audience and the characters necessary (e.g., alphanumeric, mathematical or currency symbols). You may be assigned to create a page for a language that requires a particular character set. To solve this problem, specify Unicode support for all your site's Webpages. The Unicode Technical Committee (UTC) maintains the Unicode standard. The UTC is a subcommittee of the Unicode Consortium ([www.unicode.org](http://www.unicode.org/)).
-   **Relationship management –** Every business wants to establish solid relationships with all parties involved. Two important concepts that can help you ensure success are trust-building and customer self-service. Trust is built through quality customer service and frequent contact. Customer self-service includes the ability to track orders, customize orders (such as modify or cancel an order, change a shipping address, etc.) and choose products without the help of a live person.

## Databases and Webpages

Websites can use databases to store information about the products a company is ready to sell. Webpages can also be used to obtain information from end users and store it in a database. To accomplish this, you can use HTML code to create a user-input form.

A form allows end users to enter information into a Webpage that sends the information to an organization or business. There are various types of forms. When an end user enters information into a form and clicks OK or Send, the page sends the user's information to a database in which the information can be processed. Information might include opinions or user preferences, bids in eBay auctions ([www.ebay.com](http://www.ebay.com/)), or credit card information to make purchases from a company such as Amazon.com ([www.amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/)).

### Web Server Technologies
![[Pasted image 20220615233938.png]]
### Support for Mobile Devices

As you create Webpages, consider that more and more people are viewing Webpages using smartphones and mobile devices instead of standard browsers.

It is vital that you take the time to ensure that your pages render well on various devices, including traditional desktop computers as well as a variety of mobile devices.

## Potential Front-end Issues

Potential front-end issues are essentially layout issues. These issues are usually the first consideration when designing a Webpage — especially a home page. If the home page looks good, many visitors will want to continue exploring the Website.

Front-end issues are essentially interface issues. The back end is usually the Web server, the network, and databases. A Webpage front end acts as an interface for information. You can structure the information in tables, forms, and other less-formal ways. A properly created Webpage should:

-   Be accessible by all users, including those with disabilities (e.g., hearing or sight impairment).
-   Incorporate attractive images and graphical elements.
-   Contain constantly updated hyperlinks and content.
-   Use tables wisely (**_ideally, tables should be used to place information in tabular format, not to structure entire webpages_**).
-   Present carefully designed forms.
-   Securely attach pages to databases.
-   Use the most current technologies.
-   Use images sparingly.
-   Be easily navigable and without dead ends.
-   Include alternative navigation links.

### Site Maps

A site map can be an important part of Webpage accessibility. It allows visitors to view a summary of your Website's structure. A site map should show the locations of all site sections, usually beginning with the index page on top.

Useful site maps include the following:

-   **Topical Hierarchy –** A site map should clearly outline the site's sections in a visual, hierarchical format. However, do not provide only a graphic as a site map. Alternative browsers may not render the graphic, and alternative image text may not describe the graphic's content adequately for users who cannot see it.
-   **Aptly names site sections –** Make sure that each section of your site is named accurately to enable users to find the pages they need.
-   **Search capability –** Visitors might not find the exact information they seek even after consulting your site map. You can include a search engine text box on the site map page (or a link to your site's search engine) so that visitors can search for the resource they want.

### Creative Design and Branding Standards

As discussed, a Webpage is often part of a larger marketing and sales strategy. In fact, Websites have become a means for creating and ensuring brand recognition and mind share. In short, Websites have become an important marketing tool. You must design your Webpages according to marketing demands. To do this, you should understand the motivations of a marketing specialist.

**_Design and branding standards meetings_**

You will probably need to meet with various departments and individuals to ensure that your Website complements the company's branding strategy as effectively as possible. Such meetings generally focus on the following:

-   Target markets
-   Market messages
-   Media choices
-   Color combinations
-   Sales strategies
-   Technologies you want to use

**_Audience development techniques_**

You may be asked for your input regarding ways to develop an audience for your Website. You might discuss the following methods:

-   Providing standard Website features, including properly placed video, audio, and active content. Providing unique Website features, which include ideas generated by you and your Web team, and input from other areas of the company (marketing, sales, upper management).
-   Using logos and other images traditionally used by the company.
-   Coordinating your efforts with traditional marketing strategies. You should work with the marketing department to ensure that your Website's look and feel complements the company's marketing slicks and traditional paper items (e.g., letterhead, envelopes, notepads).
-   Tracking user visits, which can indicate the popular parts of your site, and can help you to improve the unpopular parts.
-   Analyzing and interpreting statistics to help increase Website efficiency. For example, consider ways to increase visitor time at site locations where revenue is generated.
-   Working with the sales and marketing teams to obtain input from customers about desired Website features.

**_Additional techniques that can help with audience development._**
![[Pasted image 20220615234004.png]]
## Portals

A portal is a Website that acts as a centralized access point for other sites. There are two types of portals: vertical and horizontal.

-   **Vertical –** a portal dedicated to one specific interest or field (e.g., women's health, network security, sports or politics), also called a "vortal." Each linked site on a vertical portal maintains a topical focus. Examples include CNET ([www.cnet.com](http://www.cnet.com/)), Slashdot ([http://slashdot.org/](http://slashdot.org/)) and Zillow ([www.zillow.com](http://www.zillow.com/)). Intranets and extranets are also examples of vertical portals because they provide links to external sites and are dedicated to a specific topic: the businesses that host them. Intranets are sometimes known as corporate portals.
-   **Horizontal –**  a portal that provides links to various Websites with no particular focus. Examples include Google ([www.google.com](http://www.google.com/))and Yahoo! ([www.yahoo.com](http://www.yahoo.com/)) . Each of these sites contains links to other sites, but linked sites represent diverse interests (e.g., travel, news, shopping), rather than one focus.

## Wiki Sites

A wiki is a Website that allows all visitors to collaborate in its construction. You can use a wiki to create an information repository or portal. A wiki uses specialized Web-based software (called wiki software) that allows any visitor to update the site using a Web browser.

Wiki software cooperates with a Web server to generate pages in HTML so that a Web browser can render them. However, most wiki pages are written in simplified markup language called LaTeX ([www.latex-project.org](http://www.latex-project.org/)) that accommodates the fast-paced nature of a wiki site.

## Documenting Changes

As you make changes to your Website, make sure that you keep a written record of all changes. The practice of documenting changes to a site is called change management.

Documenting change is essential because it allows you to:

-   Remember which changes have been made to the HTML code and/or pages on the site.
-   Ensure that you publish all security updates to the Web server.
-   Provide evidence of good-faith efforts to ensure accessibility.
-   Verify that you have fulfilled requests from departments in your organization.

## File Formats and Active Content

Web servers provide more than just pages created in markup languages. You will populate your pages with various content formats, including Portable Document Format (PDF) documents, images and media files.

**_Common file formats and MIME types_**

All of the file formats you will use on your Webpages have a specific MIME type (a protocol that enables operating systems to map file name extensions to corresponding applications). The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) is responsible for standardizing MIME types.
![[Pasted image 20220615234039.png]]
![[Pasted image 20220615234101.png]]
**_Proprietary formats and evaluating their use_**

Many of the file types previously discussed are standard and do not require your system to have special plug-ins. Proprietary formats may require special plug-ins but can enhance the look and feel of your Website. Some proprietary formats may also cause problems for users with disabilities and limit their ability to obtain information.

## MIME

A protocol that enables operating systems to map file name extensions to corresponding applications. Also used by applications to automatically process files downloaded from the Internet.

## Back-End Issues

Server resources that process and store user input are referred to as the back end of a Website. Because you are using your Web documents to communicate over a network, you should ensure that they operate as efficiently as possible.

### Database Connectivity

Most Websites do more than simply present text, a few image files and a couple of documents. Fully functional Websites also include database connectivity. Databases provide the ability to:

-   Present stored information to customers and allow them to search and retrieve.
-   Receive information from customers and save it for later retrieval.

**_Types of databases_**

-   **Flat file –** Information is stored in a single table, often in a simple text file. The Windows registry is an example of a flat-file database.
-   **Non-relational –** Information is stored statically. Information can be searched but cannot be reorganized or placed into another database.
-   **Relational –** Information can be sorted, altered, and placed into other databases for retrieval.
-   **Object-oriented –** A newer form with the capabilities of a relational database, plus greater storage and search efficiency.

### Relational Databases

A relational database stores information in tables. These tables contain fields that allow data in the tables to be cross-referenced and joined in various ways. You or your database administrators define the categories and descriptions in the tables.

A relational database can consist of a single file or it can be distributed among several database servers. After you have organized a database, you can access its information in various ways.

**_Popular Relational Databases_****_Proprietary formats and evaluating their use_**

**_Popular Relational Databases_**
![[Pasted image 20220615234119.png]]
# **_Structured Query Language (SQL)_**

After you have created several data tables, you can query them to glean information. Generally, if you want to query a relational database, you use **Structured Query Language (SQL)**.

For more information about **SQL**, go to [https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/sql/default.asp).

### Database Connection Methods

You can connect to database files by using the Microsoft Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) interface or its Java counterpart, Java Database Connectivity (JDBC).

-   **Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) –** ODBC's primary purpose is to allow an operating system to register a database. ODBC supports SQL and all major database vendors. Once the database is registered, the operating system and its components (such as a Web server) can easily read and update the database. ODBC was developed by Microsoft and is proprietary to Windows-based operating systems.
-   **Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) –** JDBC was developed by Sun Microsystems. Unlike ODBC, JDBC is not limited to Microsoft operating systems. Like ODBC, JDBC supports major vendors (e.g., IBM and Oracle), and it also supports SQL. JDBC can be run on various systems, including Windows and UNIX. For more information, visit the Java Database Technologies page at [http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/database/index.jsp](http://java.sun.com/javase/technologies/database/index.jsp).

### Indexing and Cataloging

Another Website feature related to databases is the ability to index and catalog a site. More complex sites provide an internal search engine that allows visitors to conduct searches for site elements. Most Web servers, including Apache Server (www.apache.org) and Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) provide indexing features.

### Bandwidth and Download Time

HTML pages require a relatively small amount of space on a hard drive. Because their file size is small, they are also easy to download over a network.

Image files can be quite large. For example, a simple JPEG image of your house or apartment could easily exceed 1 MB. A file this large usually takes some time to download over a network.

Therefore, make sure that your Webpages do not reference several large files. You should also avoid using too many small image files. It is difficult to determine an acceptable download size for files associated with an HTML page. However, you must consider the total size of your page, including all images, plug-ins and other programs. As a general rule, your pages should not exceed 100 KB without a very good reason.

**_Determining download time for a Webpage_**

1.  Check the size of the HTML file and any associated images, files or programs.
2.  Determine the speed of your network connection, which is generally measured in kilobits per second (Kbps).
3.  The connection speed and the file size must be converted into a common unit of measure for division: either bytes or bits. Consider that 1 byte equals 8 bits. The connection speed is already defined in bits: 56 kilobits = 56,000 bits. To convert the file size into bits, you should first convert it into bytes (84 kilobytes = 84,000 bytes). Then convert the bytes into bits by multiplying 84,000 by 8 (1 byte = 8 bits), which results in 672,000 bits.
4.  Divide the file size (672,000 bits) by the connection speed (56,000 bits per second).

_Remember that the result derived from these four steps is a theoretical measurement. It does not consider certain factors, such as the fact that 56-Kbps modems rarely operate above 50 Kbps. Nor does it consider network overhead, noisy phone lines or network congestion._

### Default Files and the HTTP Server

You should remember that your pages will probably reside on a Web server (also called an HTTP server). Usually, an HTTP server looks for a default page, which is a specially named file. The server will present this page automatically each time a user enters the minimum amount of information required to connect to the site. Rather than having to enter the page address www.company.com/index.html, a user need only enter www.company.com. The server supplies the default page index.html automatically.

Default document names differ from server to server. Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) looks for the default.htm file. Apache HTTP server looks for the index.html file. You can change the name of the default document, but you should be aware that every Web server is preconfigured to a default document name. Following are some common default page names:

-   index.htm
-   default.htm
-   welcome.htm
-   home.htm
-   index.html
-   default.html
-   welcome.html
-   home.html
-   index.asp
-   default.asp
-   welcome.asp
-   home.asp
-   index.jsp
-   default.jsp
-   welcome.jsp
-   home.jsp

## Hosting Solution Comparison
![[Pasted image 20220615234140.png]]
### Cloud Service Providers

Traditional cloud hosting service providers offer complete Website solutions. These solutions include a Web domain, Web server space, Website building tools, Website security and bandwidth. 

Cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud are prepared to provide more complete services, including but not limited to:

-   **Software as a Service (SaaS)**, such as email, accounting, human resources management, customer-service relationship, Web hosting, and nearly any type of software.
    
-   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), such as virtual machines, firewalls, IP addresses and computing infrastructure. Backup services and nearly unlimited hard drive space on a pay-as-you go subscription.
    
-   Advanced Web and database connectivity, including the creation of custom CGI applications. Advanced Web development and machine learning tools.
    
-   Enterprise resource planning (ERP), which is the ability to automate the planning and operations of your entire organization (e.g., hiring, termination, manufacturing, marketing).

## Legal Issues and Websites

Intellectual property is a unique product or idea created by an individual or organization, and that generally has commercial value. When creating a Website, you must consider legal issues related to ideas, products and images that are widely available. You cannot "borrow" information from other Websites. The following describes common intellectual property issues and terminology.
![[Pasted image 20220615234158.png]]

**Website Ethics**

Ethics is the study of making proper choices to ensure that other people's rights are not violated. Consider the following ethical points as you create markup code and design Webpages:

-   You cannot copy a site's code or look without the owner's explicit permission. You can create entirely new code that provides a similar look and feel, but consider the perception you present if your site looks just like another.
-   Borrowing a lot of code from a site infringes upon the author's copyright.
-   The owner of a copyright may allow copyrighted material to be used by others. This permission may be exchanged by contract, for a fee or simply for proper attribution. Most major Websites post their copyright and licensing contact information.
-   All aspects of a Website are copyrighted. Do not "borrow" images, text, logos, music, scripts, applications or code. Seek proper permission if you find an element on a site that you want to use.
-   You cannot provide a link from your Website to another site without permission because such a link generally implies that the two sites have a business relationship.
-   You cannot copy or translate the content of another Website without explicit permission.
-   Copyright and trademark laws are country-specific. The World Wide Web allows a person from one country to view information from all over the world. Suppose your employer asks you to research national and international copyright laws.

Stealing the intellectual property of others is a serious matter. You must avoid even appearing as if you have stolen information. Ways to avoid problems include:

-   **Reviewing all Website content for originality** — This includes code, images and text. The review must be independent. In other words, choose someone who is not on your team but who will work diligently to highlight any potential infringement issues.
-   **Conducting regular content reviews** — A single content review at the end of the project may not solve infringement problems. Regular reviews are likely to encourage development team members to change their practices so that you do not have a large problem to resolve near a deadline.
-   **Obtaining express, written consent for any material you use** — Make sure that written consent is properly stored for later retrieval, and that developers do not take advantage of this consent. Even specific design concepts are copyrighted, so if you "borrow" someone else's unique expression for your own site, you may incur legal action. Of course, images and code are all protected by copyright.
-   **Creating reasonable deadlines** — Busy developers often take shortcuts to meet deadlines. Work with your project manager to ensure that deadline pressure does not contribute to a team's tendency to copy content.
