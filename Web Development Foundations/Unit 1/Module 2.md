## HTML Basic Elements
1. ```<!DOCTYPE html>``` : the document type declaration is mandatory and informs the browser which version of HTML is being used. The value html indicates HTML version 5. A declaration is a statement that informs the browser of the information needed to correctly handle the elements within. In other words, the declaration tells the browser how to decode the tags that will follow. 
2. ``` <html>```: element that encompasses the whole document 
3. ```<head>```: the page header information
4.``` <title>```: informs the page title to be used by the browser to be displayed over the window or tab displaying the web page
5. ```<body>```: the page body that encompasses the text to be displayed by the browser
6.``` <h1> -> <h6>```: the headings of the web page main text that follow specific text formatting and text structure
7. ```<p>```: the paragraphs of the web page text that hold the regular text.
8. ```<br>```: the single tag to create a line break.
9. ```<hr>```: tag to display a change of context, usually displayed with a horizontal line.
10. ```<strong>```: a tag to modify the weight of text relative to surrounding text, which usually is equivalent to bold 

**Two types of HTML elements**
	One could easily divide HTML elements into two groups. The first group consists of elements that refer to parts of a document: headers, paragraphs, tables, forms, lists, and so on. ```<h1>, <p>, <table>, <ul>```We call this semantic HTML as they refer to the names of things; they describe what they are.  
	
   Another group contains the elements used to indicate how things look: how they are aligned, which font is used, if it is in bold or italics, and so on  ```<center>, <font>, <b>, <i>``` and we could call them presentational HTML. The same is true for HTML attributes.  class="green" or id="chapter" would be semantic, while width="150px" or valign="top" would be presentational.
