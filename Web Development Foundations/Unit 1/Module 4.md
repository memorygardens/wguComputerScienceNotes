# User Input 
### User Input in Web Pages 
Types of Input Tags 
-	textual, like text, number, email and password
-	non-textual, like radio, range, checkbox, color, file and button
	--- range and checkbox are multi select, radio is not. 

The _action_ attribute specifies the name and location of the CGI script used to process the form

**Form Method Attribute** 
-   "get" — Form data is appended to the URL of the webpage for use in a query string. This method sends information in cleartext and is not secure.
-   "post" — Form data is appended within the body of the HTTP request with the action attribute. Post is the preferred method for sending form data because it is more secure. It can also send more characters than get.
