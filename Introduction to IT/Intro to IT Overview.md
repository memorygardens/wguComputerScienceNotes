User Support

-    IT provides support to users by first analyzing the needs and issues, then identifying and implementing solutions so users can stay productive with minimal technical interruption.

Data and Information Management

-   IT professionals build systems to enable storage, retrieval, analysis, and use of organization data and information with an eye on disaster recovery and business continuity to mitigate the high costs of losing data.

Networks

-   Networking technologies rely on hardware and software to connect computer systems and data repositories, whether they are a few feet apart from each other in a single room or thousands of miles apart on separate continents.

Systems Integration

-   The deployment of those systems in an organization often requires setting up and configuring the product to align with the specific organizational needs and to integrate with other systems already in use. In these cases, IT professionals engage in complex activities to ensure the new product integrates with the organization’s infrastructure ecosystem.

Core Components of IT Hardware

-   Hard Disk

A disk on which information is saved and stored in the computer even when it is not connected

to a power supply.

-   Monitor

An output device that displays information in pictorial form, allowing the user to interact with

the computer interface and open programs typically using a keyboard and mouse.

-   Motherboard

One of the most essential parts of a computer system that holds many of the crucial

components of a computer, including connectors for input and output devices.

-   CPU (Central Processing Unit)

A control center that converts data input to information output. This is a highly complex,

extensive set of electronic circuitry that executes stored program instructions.

-   RAM (Random Access Memory)

The memory within the computer that holds the running programs and data when the

computer is in use. Data can be read and written quickly in any order.

-   Network Cables

These cables connect and transfer data and information between computers.

-   Wi-Fi Routers

Wi-Fi routers transmit, receive, and decode information sent using radio waves.

-   Laser Printers

These printers use a laser to form a pattern of electrostatically charged dots on a light-sensitive

drum, which attracts toner (or dry ink powder). The toner is transferred to a paper and is fixed

by a heating process.

Core Components of IT Software

Software Development

-   Organizations strive to provide the best combination of software products to their employees to support business processes. Identifying and implementing systems that help the organization perform tasks more efficiently or provide novel services to clients can help organizations gain competitive advantages in their respective industries and elevate their reputation

**Business Analysis**

**Security**

-   Organizations aim to put secure systems in place to identify threats and prevent incidents that compromise the organization’s data or disrupt the business.

**The Business of IT**

**Web Development**

-   Internet are public facing websites, such as e-commerce and social media (Everyone)
-   Intranet are private facing and used by the business to pass information and data for business needs (Business Only)
-   Extranet is private business data and information that is shared with clients and other third parties that the business is in contact with. (Who the Business wants Access to)

**Business Intelligence**

-   Organizations gather data to support their decision-making process and discover opportunities to better serve their customers, optimize their processes, and maintain or gain a competitive advantage in an industry.

**Project Management**

-   Organizations need to ensure that projects execute in a manageable fashion, maintain scope, and optimize use of resources.

--Information is a collection of processed data from a variety of sources. Data is continually aggregating and is not useful until it has been processed and is presented in a usable form. Data includes raw facts or observations.

Once data is organized, information can be inferred. Asking the questions why, who, what, where, and how allows us to use the data in a meaningful way and support decisions.

Information can be structured or unstructured, and the key term associated with it is _meaning_.

_Knowledge_ is hard to define. A more frequently used definition is the following:

_Knowledge_ is a dynamic combination of experience, values, contextual information, expert insight, and grounded intuition that provides an environment and framework for evaluating and incorporating new experiences and information. It originates and is applied in the minds of knowers. In organizations, it often becomes embedded not only in documents and repositories but also in organizational routines, processes, practices, and norms.

The key term associated with knowledge is _context_.

_Wisdom_ is knowing the right thing to do.

![[Pasted image 20220508223015.png]]
--Connectedness wisdom is essentially “the path to connected understanding” when interpreting data

![[Pasted image 20220508223029.png]]
--Big data and data science take us from seeing and learning from the past and present to looking at the future.

**Structured and Unstructured Data** 
- Unstructured is most data. Social media post and the like, it is unorganized data that is difficult or impossible to analysis. Example text or video format.
- Structured data is coded in a way that makes it easy to convert into a form usable for analysis. Example: contact information. 

**Big Data**	
-	large amounts of data usually unstructured. Tools are used to analysis to try and see trends in customers. 

**Information Systems**
-	Are collections of data and information used to support decision-making in an organization. 

**Data Management**
-	The infrastructure used to manage data in an organization is referred to as the data architecture. 

(IaaS) **Infrastructure as a Service**
-	provides access in a virtualized environment and the computing resources are composed of virtualized hardware. 

(PaaS) **Platform as a Service**
-	customers have access to a platform that supports the development and management of web applications. reduced infrastructure requirements. If the customer is not in charge of the OS and routing it is PaaS if they are it is IaaS 

(SaaS) **Software as a Service**
-  example gmail, outlook, excel. Subscription service software. 

#### Data Sources
-	CRM- customer relationship management-> sales records, finance
-	ERP- enterprise resource planning.

#### Data Quality
-	**Good Data Enables**
	-   Analyze the current financial state of the organization in terms of net profits, revenues, cash flow, assets, and liabilities
	-   Increase revenues through better targeting of products and increased customer satisfaction
	-   Examine existing production processes to take corrective action, improve efficiency, and lower costs
	-   Develop new, automated processes that integrate harmoniously into existing workflows and reduce demands on labor
	-   Gather competitive information on product and pricing decisions to stay ahead of competitors
	-   Make evidence-based decisions that utilize verifiable data to maximize profits and efficiency
	-   Understand business value by exploiting rapid changes in information and generating insights from diverse data sources to widen the competitive differentiation gap

-	**Data hygiene:** refers to the processes of ensuring the cleanliness of data. (error-free) 

- **Bad Data** 
- ![[Pasted image 20220515182226.png]]

- **Quality Data Attributes**
	- Quality data is typically defined as data that is precise, valid, reliable, timely, and complete.

**IPO**: Input Process Output

Two different types of Networking. 
-	Client to server: users signing into an identity server to log into a sit.  enterprise 
-	peer to peer : BitTorrent is a protocol that enables peer to peer file sharing. in small offices and homes.

Physical Topology: is a physical image of the connections within a network

Logical Topology: how the data actually flow and is extremely important when considering things like load balancing normal traffic, network backups and replication of data. 

Most common topology layout are bus, star, ring and mesh. 

TCP/IP: internet and home network protocol.
