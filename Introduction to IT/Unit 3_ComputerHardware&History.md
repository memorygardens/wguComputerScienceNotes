# Unit 3 Goals
-   Summarize the characteristics of computing systems from the first to the fourth generation. 
-   Identify the difference between scripting and programming languages. 
-   Differentiate between input, output, and storage. 
-   Define _system_. 
-   Identify components of computer hardware. 
-   Differentiate between motherboard components, their purposes, and their properties. 
-   Describe the role of a central processing unit (CPU) in a computing environment. 
-   Classify peripherals by their role (input, output, temporary memory, storage). 
-   Identify computer peripherals. 
-   Identify the categories of computers according to their components and capabilities. 
-   Identify storage and input/output (I/O) systems including different media and file systems.

## Model 7: History of the Computer

#### The Four Generations of  Computers 
	-	First: 1946-1959 Mostly Military opperations ENIC (as big as a warehouse) **Vacuum Tubes** 
	-	Second: 1959-Mids 60s. **Transistors** first used. Would take up a room. Called Mainframes. New software, Assembly Languages. COBOL- business and Fortran- math
	-	Third: Mid 60s- Early 70s: Beginning of Modern Computing. **Intergrated Circuits** begin. 
	-	Fourth: Early 70s-Now: Desktops, laptops, PIMS to smart phones. Input devices from punch cards to touchscreens. **Microprocessors** 
	-	Fifth: AI and machine language. Quantum Computing 
	
#### Artificial Intelligence
-	Modern computing is based around parallel processing, which lead to the birth of AI. AI and natural language processing use the principles of robotics, neural networks, expert systems and natural language understanding and generation. 
-	 Quantum computing, molecular technology, and nanotechnology are the keys to the future of AI and 5th gen computing.
	-	 Quantum Computing: is the study of a non-classical model of computation. It is said to be more efficient than modern computing though the use of quantum tunneling. 
	-	 Nanotechnology: involves the use of nanoscale tools and nonbiological processes to build structures, devices and systems at the molecular level. Based on the ability to build complex structures, possible at an atomic level, by using mechanosynthesis.
