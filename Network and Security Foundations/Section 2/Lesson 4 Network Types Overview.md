### PAN

Diagram. A Personal Area Network (PAN)

A personal area network, or PAN, is a network that is centered around a person and their devices. A PAN allows for various devices, such as a personâ€™s desktop computer, laptop, smartphone, tablet, headphones, wireless keyboard and mouse, and speakers to communicate with each other, often over Bluetooth in the case of wireless connections or USB in the case of wired connections. PANs can be used to enable communication between the devices, such as a device sending music to speakers or headphones, or can be used as a jumping-off point for other devices to a network gateway, such as when a mobile phone acts as a Wi-Fi hotspot for other devices.

Apple products are a good example of this. Apple has built their products to integrate together via iCloud. Each device is registered to a single user account. When a user account has multiple devices, notifications, workflow, and data are easily shared across them. For example, when a phone call is being received by an iPhone, it also will alert a MacBook and an iPad that are connected to the PAN. The call is able to be answered by any of the devices.

### LAN

Diagram. A Local Area Network (LAN)

A local area network, or LAN, consists of computers connected within a limited area. Some examples of LANs are a home, lab, or office building. Most often, LANs use Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or both to connect the network devices.

LANs were popularized in the 1960s for research labs that needed their computers to be connected and able to transfer data at high speeds (at that time). While similar to LANs today, there was significant growth and development through the following decades to LANs. It was not until the 1980s that LANs supported TCP/IP and the commands and programs were often used with it as well as PCs (as opposed to mainframes or minicomputers), which opened the market for even more expansion into LANs as they are known today.

Many LANs are wireless, where users are connected via Wi-Fi and can move unrestricted throughout the coverage area. This is a popular choice for home users and small businesses, as it is easy and inexpensive to install and allows guests to use the network as well.

### WLAN

A wireless local area network, or WLAN, is a LAN with wireless connectivity. Unlike LANs, which are wired, WLANs use Wi-Fi to communicate with devices. Users and devices can be placed anywhere and move anywhere in the coverage area. This is a popular choice for small businesses, as it is easy and inexpensive to install and allows guests to use the network as well with a hotspot service. Many WLANs also act as a gateway to the internet for users.

Many private homes use WLAN in the form of Wi-Fi, as it allows for multiple users to be connected to the network (and usually the broader internet), but not be tied down to a specific location in the home.

### SAN

A storage area network, or SAN, is a network that allows access to storage devices specifically instead of the more general networking that can be used for any purpose. SANs allow servers to access devices such as tape libraries and disk arrays while presenting them to the operating system like any other locally attached device.

Typically, a SAN is a network dedicated to storage devices and the servers that need access to them. The key reason for this is to reduce interference from normal LAN traffic during data transfer. SANs may also use other protocols, such as Fibre Channels that do not usually operate on traditional network equipment.

### CAN

Diagram. Campus area network (CAN).

A campus area network, or CAN, provides networking of multiple LANs across a limited area, like a university campus or a group of buildings owned by a company. Each LAN would typically be constrained to a single building (or even just a part of a building), and the CAN would link them together in much the same way that a WAN (wide area network, which will be defined later) does but over a smaller geographic area. The CAN typically connects LANs owned by a single company, university, government agency, etc.

### MAN

Diagram. Metropolitan area network (MAN).

A metropolitan area network, or MAN, provides networking across a larger area than a CAN, but smaller than a WAN, such as a whole city or the equivalent of a metropolitan area (hence the name), though it is not necessarily limited by city boundaries. A MAN is made up of many LANs and is owned by many organizations, government entities, etc., within the city to create a fabric of network coverage, often at higher speeds than maybe commercially viable when connecting directly to a WAN when connecting to other entities in the same MAN. Often, this MAN is then connected to a larger WAN (usually the internet) for access beyond the city.

### WAN

Diagram. Wide area network (WAN).

A wide area network, or WAN, is similar to a LAN, except that it covers a large geographical area within its network. This would be the case for worldwide businesses or government bodies. The internet is an example of a WAN, as it can connect individual users across the globe.

While the technical definition of a WAN is a network spanning a city, countries, or the entire earth, it is easier to think of WANs as a network that connects smaller networks, like LANs. WANs are able to link these smaller networks to transfer data over hundreds of thousands of miles, whereas a true LAN is only able to do so over its small network.

For example, banks use private WANs to connect hundreds of branches across the nation. This allows their sensitive user information to be passed from branch to branch without compromising security or traveling over a public network like the internet. Because of this, a banking customer can go to any branch across a country and have access to their accounts and funds.

In contrast to the above types of networking, there are two other ways of looking at networks: they are defined by who has the resources and who needs access to them.

### Client-Server

Diagram. Client-Server Network

In a client-server network model, there is a distinct server and a distinct client. The server is the system that stores data and information. The client is the machine that needs access to that data. This is the traditional model of networking since the 1990s.

### Peer-to-Peer

![4 computers in a peer-to-peer network connected to a single switch.](https://assets.wgu.edu/53f5e5df6087bc9af0f2b8e52cd79e4a)

Diagram. Peer-to-peer network.

In a peer-to-peer model, or P2P, there is no individually designated server or client. Each machine on the network can act as both server and client, sometimes requesting data from other nodes and sometimes answering requests from others. Bitcoin and Tor are examples of peer-to-peer networks.
