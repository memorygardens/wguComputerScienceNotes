### Virtualization

Virtualization has been used in IT since the 1970s, when large mainframes and minicomputers needed to be logically divided into smaller virtualized computers to run workloads in isolation. Today, virtualization fulfills similar purposes, such as allowing one physical server to host many different virtual machines or to create network devices on demand, such as virtual routers and firewalls.

Virtual devices operate similarly to their physical counterparts but with a few differences and benefits. The very nature of these virtual devices practically gives administrators superpowers in the data center. Tasks that would be challenging or even impossible with physical devices now become commonplace, thanks to virtualization. For instance, you can do the following:

-   deploy new virtual devices quickly and on demand without the need to physically install new hardware move virtual devices within a data center or even between data centers without shipping or moving physical equipment
-   increase the reliability of an application or service by virtualizing it and separating it from hardware that may have once been a single point of failure (SPoF)
-   create point-in-time snapshots or clones of virtual devices for backup and recovery purposes
-   increase or decrease the compute, storage, and network resources allocated to a virtual device on demand as its utilization rises and falls

### Hypervisors

Virtualization relies on a special type of software, known as a hypervisor, which creates the virtual hardware for devices. There are many different varieties of hypervisors, including open source and commercial. Some hypervisors run as standalone applications on Windows, MacOS, or Linux, whereas other hypervisors are installed as the underlying operating system itself. Regardless, all hypervisors have something in common: they use software to create the illusion of physical hardware.

Hardware is essentially programming instructions baked into copper and silicon chips. With enough skill, you could recreate that programming in software. Now imagine that you learn how to recreate all the hardware in a computer’s motherboard as a series of software programs. You continue the process with its graphics card, network card, and even its hard drive. You now have a collection of programs that, when connected together, have the appearance of a physical computer, but it is executing as software. This is virtualization, and you have just created your first set of virtual hardware. Each instance of virtual hardware is called a virtual machine, or VM.

The virtual hardware is such an elaborate and convincing illusion that you can actually install a real operating system within the VM, and it works as if it had been installed on physical hardware. The operating system (OS) installed within the VM is often referred to as a guest OS to differentiate it from the operating system of the underlying physical computer, which is called the host OS. To help you remember these terms, just think of the hypervisor as a host to a number of house guests called VMs.

The hypervisor provides the VM, and therefore the guest OS, access to the physical CPU and RAM resources as well as access to a virtual disk that the guest OS believes is a real, physical hard drive. Optionally, you may also provide a virtual network card that also appears real and that will give the VM access to the network. With few exceptions, the guest OS will behave in the same way it would if it had been installed directly on physical hardware. To make the illusion complete, some hypervisors include special device drivers that you can install within the guest OS to gain performance improvements and access to features that would be otherwise impossible on physical hardware.

Hypervisors are able to host multiple VMs, each running its own guest OS and applications. Each VM has its own virtual hardware that the hypervisor manages and keeps isolated and independent of the other VMs. The hypervisor serves as a resource traffic cop in that it manages how each VM accesses and consumes the physical hardware resources, such as CPU, RAM, networking, and storage. To the rest of the world, these VMs appear as isolated and independent as individual physical servers. Also, despite the magic of virtualization, VMs still cannot communicate telepathically with one another. So, if you want them to talk to each other, you will have to install virtual network adapters in the VMs and configure their networking as you would do with your physical servers.

There are two types of hypervisors: Type 1 (bare metal) and Type 2 (hosted). Both types can host VMs; however, they have very different use cases. Type 2 hypervisors, which you will learn about first, look and feel like any other application that you may run on your laptop. Type 1 hypervisors typically requires dedicated hardware and are installed as that machine’s operating system, making them more commonly found in data centers than in home networks.

Diagram. Type 1 and Type 2 hypervisors.

#### Type 1 Hypervisors

Type 1 hypervisors, also called bare- metal hypervisors, differ from Type 2 hypervisors in the way they are installed. Remember that a Type 2 hypervisor, such as VMware Workstation, is installed as an application within your existing computer or laptop operating system. Type 1 hypervisors, such as VMware ESXi or the open-source KVM hypervisor, are operating systems that natively run virtual machines and are intended to be installed on a dedicated bare metal server. This is a significant difference because, as an operating system, the Type 1 hypervisor has complete access to the underlying hardware of the physical computer, which alleviates the performance penalty that Type 2 hypervisors commonly face.

Another important difference between the hypervisors is in how you access and manage the host and the guests. Type 1 hypervisors present very little information to the console screen of the host computer. While there may be a limited user interface for troubleshooting the hypervisor directly, all administration is typically performed from another computer, such as your laptop. On your laptop, you would direct a web browser to the IP address or hostname of the hypervisor to access its web-based administration portal.

To make this a bit clearer, consider the earlier example of using VMware Workstation to run a Windows Server VM on your laptop. The hypervisor was just an application installed on your Windows 10 laptop that you were logged in to and that was able to directly interact with the settings of Windows 10 (your laptop), VMware Workstation (the hypervisor), and Windows Server (the VM). Conversely, if you have installed a Type 1 hypervisor on a computer, you can see the basic troubleshooting interface on its monitor but must use a web browser on a separate computer to administer the hypervisor and the VMs running on it.

Also, remember that VMs are typically connected to the network just like any other physical computer. Users that need to connect to a VM typically are not granted access to the hypervisor configuration portal; rather, they are given an IP address or hostname for the VM that they need to connect to.

#### Type 2 Hypervisors

A Type 2 hypervisor, sometimes referred to as a hosted hypervisor, is installed as an application on personal computers or laptops. This allows the user to run different VMs that all share the laptop or computer’s hardware resources. This allows you to run operating systems within a VM other than what was natively installed on your computer or laptop. For instance, imagine that you are an application developer creating a new application that will run on Windows Server. Your laptop is running Windows 10, which is similar to Windows Server but may not be close enough for you to properly test your application. You could install a Type 2 hypervisor, such as VMware Workstation or Microsoft Hyper-V, to allow you to run VMs on your laptop. This would allow you to create a VM running Windows Server and then log in to the VM to install and test your application.

In another example, you are a student with a laptop running MacOS. One of your classes requires you to gain familiarity with Linux, but you do not want to purchase a second computer. Again, you could install a Type 2 hypervisor for MacOS, such as VMware Fusion or Parallels Desktop, which would allow you to create and run a Linux VM on your laptop.

One important aspect of Type 2 hypervisors is that they are installed and run as a regular application on your computer or laptop. This means two things: first, the hypervisor is competing for hardware resources with all the other running applications on your computer; and second, the hypervisor does not have direct and unrestricted access to the physical hardware but instead must send all your VM’s hardware requests through your computer’s operating system. Both issues can lead to degraded performance within your VMs, but slower performance may be far more desirable than buying and carrying around separate computers.

### Cloud Computing

![Some computers and devices are specifically networked together, some are not; but they are all connected to the cloud.](https://assets.wgu.edu/9f276c6c437b1b97284710b9c8687e12)

Diagram. Cloud computing.

Cloud computing may be the most commonly used term in IT, but if you ask an IT professional to define it, you will likely get the response, “It depends.” Pinpointing a single definition for cloud computing is difficult because it is many things to many people. Instead of trying to find one all-encompassing definition, consider the meaning and business implications for some of the more well-known and accepted characteristics of cloud computing: on-demand, self-service, resource pooling, elastic, accessible, and measurable.

Business owners and executives do not usually make impulse decisions about strategic direction, mergers and acquisitions, or massive marketing campaigns, but it can seem that way if IT is left out of the decision-making process. Implementing change takes time, and in the business world, time can cost you opportunities. Therefore, a quick reaction time within IT is critical to the success of the business. Without cloud computing, it may take weeks to acquire the necessary hardware, software, and manpower to satisfy the new business needs. The on-demand nature of cloud computing provides IT professionals the means to provision new servers, applications, and other resources in a self-service manner, often within minutes of the request.

Cloud providers, such as Amazon (AWS), Google (GCP), and Microsoft (Azure), purchase and manage vast quantities of compute, storage, and networking resources around the world. In doing so, they are able to pool these resources to achieve economies of scale, which can improve pricing and provide additional capacity to their customers for sudden bursts in their businesses. It is in this elasticity where cloud computing proves to be an immense business asset. Consider that you run a retail business with an e-commerce website. Most of the year, your website traffic is predictably average, but during the three months of the holiday shopping season, your website receives so much traffic that it occasionally crashes or performs so poorly that customers go elsewhere. What you need is a data center that can dynamically increase in size during the busy months and then shrink back down to size during the rest of the year. This elasticity, often referred to as scalability, is yet another key benefit of cloud providers. During your busy months, you could leverage the resources of a cloud provider to keep up with customer demand and then recede back to your own data center during the rest of the year.

Another reason cloud computing is so popular is the global reach that it provides companies. Consider again the retail business example. Imagine the business is located in a small town in the middle of the United States, but its products and services attract a global customer base. Currently, the business’s website is hosted in one location in the United States, which is great for U.S. customers, but the site is slow when accessed from Europe or Asia. To counter this problem, the company could leverage the global presence of cloud providers to host their website in data centers around the world. This improves their customer’s experience, which in turn may improve sales.

Finally, services in the cloud must be measurable. This alludes to the way that you pay for services in the cloud. Much like the way you pay for electricity or water at your home, cloud providers tend to charge you only for what you consume. This could be the number of hours that your virtual machines are running, the amount of data storage you have consumed, or even the number of gigabytes of network bandwidth that your customers consumed while browsing your website. So, just as you turn the lights off as you leave a room, do the same in the cloud. When not using resources, such as test or development systems, power them down and remove extra and unnecessary data. Of course, if you tend to leave the lights on, they will stay on, but you can expect a hefty bill at the end of the month. Ultimately, if you are conscientious about how you consume cloud resources, you will likely find cloud computing to be a very affordable alternative to traditional data centers.

Products and services within cloud computing are organized based on the type of service being offered and by the location where the service is hosted. The various types of cloud services are categorized by the cloud service models, whereas the hosting locations are classified by the cloud deployment models.
